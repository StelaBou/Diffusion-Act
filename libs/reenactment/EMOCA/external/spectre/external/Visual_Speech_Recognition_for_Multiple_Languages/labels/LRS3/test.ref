test/0Fi83BHQsMA/00002 WE REALLY DON'T WALK ANYMORE
test/0Fi83BHQsMA/00004 AT SOME POINT I'M GOING TO GET OUT
test/0Fi83BHQsMA/00005 WHEN I GET OUT OF THIS AM I GOING TO BE REJECTED
test/0Fi83BHQsMA/00006 WE'D LOVE TO HELP
test/0QVXdEOiCw8/00001 I WASN'T VERY GOOD AT READING THINGS
test/0VJqrlH9cdI/00001 AND HE SAID ON THE SPOT ABSOLUTELY YES
test/0VJqrlH9cdI/00002 HE WAS SMILING AND WE SAID GO
test/0ZfSOArXbGQ/00001 WE SAID YES
test/0ZfSOArXbGQ/00002 WE WERE SO EXCITED
test/0ZfSOArXbGQ/00003 AND SO ONE OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES OF OUR PROJECT REALLY IS TO FIND PHOTOGRAPHS THAT WERE TAKEN BEFORE SOMETHING
test/0gks6ceq4eQ/00002 NOT WHAT IS IT
test/0gks6ceq4eQ/00005 PREDICTIONS ARE THE BASIS OF EVERY EXPERIENCE THAT YOU HAVE
test/0gks6ceq4eQ/00006 THEY ARE THE BASIS OF EVERY ACTION THAT YOU TAKE
test/0gks6ceq4eQ/00007 IT'S USING PAST EXPERIENCE BASED ON SIMILAR SITUATIONS TO TRY TO MAKE MEANING
test/0gks6ceq4eQ/00008 AND SO HOW DOES YOUR BRAIN GIVE YOU THAT DETAIL
test/0gks6ceq4eQ/00009 WELL THAT'S WHAT PREDICTIONS ARE
test/0gks6ceq4eQ/00010 I'M TOTALLY SERIOUS
test/0gks6ceq4eQ/00013 I KNOW I HAVE
test/0gks6ceq4eQ/00015 SO WHEN YOU'RE BORN YOU CAN MAKE FEELINGS LIKE CALMNESS AND
test/0iIh5YYDR2o/00001 I'M NOT A SOCIAL PROBLEM GUY
test/18uDutylDa4/00001 I FEEL GUILTY SOMETIMES
test/18uDutylDa4/00002 SO I'M NOT SAYING THAT STAYING IN THE WORKFORCE IS THE RIGHT THING FOR EVERYONE
test/18uDutylDa4/00004 BOY IT MATTERS A LOT
test/18uDutylDa4/00007 WHAT DO YOU MEAN
test/18uDutylDa4/00009 YOUR JOB NEEDS TO BE CHALLENGING
test/18uDutylDa4/00010 HE'S A GREAT GUY
test/18uDutylDa4/00011 YOU WANT TO WORK FOR HIM
test/1K5SycZjGhI/00001 BLOCKS HAVE NAMES
test/1L6lSFiV4xo/00002 YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER TERM AND LOOK THAT UP
test/1L6lSFiV4xo/00003 I DO LIKE MAGIC
test/1PNX6MSdVsk/00001 I DON'T HAVE AN OVERVIEW
test/1PNX6MSdVsk/00005 MORE TRUST IS NOT AN INTELLIGENT AIM IN THIS LIFE
test/1PNX6MSdVsk/00007 TRUST IS THE RESPONSE
test/1PNX6MSdVsk/00009 WE CAN DO IT TWO PEOPLE TOGETHER TRYING TO IMPROVE TRUST
test/1PNX6MSdVsk/00010 BECAUSE IT'S GIVEN BY OTHER PEOPLE
test/1PNX6MSdVsk/00011 LET ME GIVE YOU A SIMPLE COMMERCIAL EXAMPLE
test/1US4jjWtua8/00001 WE'RE GOING TO EAT THESE COWS
test/1US4jjWtua8/00002 THEY'RE NOT BEING SHIPPED UP HERE
test/1US4jjWtua8/00004 IT'S NOT OPTIONAL

test/1bnzVjOJ6NM/00005 MORTALITY IS NOT GOING DOWN IT'S GOING UP
test/1bnzVjOJ6NM/00006 AND NOT ENOUGH IS BEING DONE ABOUT THIS
test/1bnzVjOJ6NM/00007 IT TOLD US ABOUT HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY
test/1bnzVjOJ6NM/00011 WOMEN ARE WORTH IT
test/1bnzVjOJ6NM/00013 SO WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS TO THESE GALS
test/1bnzVjOJ6NM/00014 THEY'RE OFTEN NOT RECOGNIZED SENT HOME
test/1bnzVjOJ6NM/00015 I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT WAS
test/1bnzVjOJ6NM/00017 WELL ONCE AGAIN WOMEN GET THE ANGIOGRAM AND NOBODY CAN TELL THAT THEY HAVE A PROBLEM
test/1bnzVjOJ6NM/00020 AND WE'D LIKE TO THINK IT'S NOT GOING TO TAKE 35 YEARS
test/1bnzVjOJ6NM/00021 AND IN FACT IT PROBABLY WON'T
test/1bnzVjOJ6NM/00022 SO WE HAVE THESE FEAST AND FAMINE CYCLES
test/1bnzVjOJ6NM/00023 SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION
test/27lMmdmySb8/00001 EVERYBODY FOCUSES ON THE THINGS THAT KILL US AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS FOCUSING ON
test/27lMmdmySb8/00002 AND THEY WANTED TO LOOK AT THE MICROBES AFTER THE TRANSPLANTS

test/27lMmdmySb8/00006 WE CAN'T SEE IT MOST OF THE TIME
test/27lMmdmySb8/00008 AND THEY DEFINITELY HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN SOME CASES
test/2SlBiFZ85d0/00002 I HAVE THREE SONS SO I SEE HOW THEY FIGHT
test/2SlBiFZ85d0/00003 WE'RE NOT JUST PART OF THE SAME SPECIES
test/2SlBiFZ85d0/00004 WE'RE PART OF THE SAME FAMILY
test/2SlBiFZ85d0/00006 AND I WON'T NAME NAMES BUT YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE
test/2SlBiFZ85d0/00008 SO THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING
test/2UStOghblfE/00001 WHY ARE WE EMBEDDED IN SOCIAL NETWORKS
test/2UStOghblfE/00002 I MEAN HOW DO THEY FORM
test/2UStOghblfE/00003 HOW DO THEY OPERATE
test/2UStOghblfE/00004 HOW FAR DO THEY REACH
test/2UStOghblfE/00005 AND THE DAUGHTER WAS EXHAUSTED FROM CARING FOR HER MOTHER
test/3A1LvXRnpVg/00001 GIVE ME INPUT
test/3OgsRa7VDtI/00001 THEY CAN'T GET WHAT THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT

test/3OgsRa7VDtI/00008 YES IT'S HARD

test/3r1IPsldbBg/00003 WE SHOULDN'T BE NATIONALISTIC
test/3uSQlcGCHUU/00001 THIS ECONOMY WON'T WORK AND THOMAS JEFFERSON SAYING THE PEOPLE WON'T TRUST THAT
test/3uSQlcGCHUU/00006 BUT THAT SYSTEM HAS TONS OF PROBLEMS
test/3uSQlcGCHUU/00008 WEALTH IS RIPPED AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHO SHOULDN'T BE CALLED UNPRODUCTIVE
test/3uSQlcGCHUU/00011 BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE AT ALL
test/3uSQlcGCHUU/00012 OR DO YOU THINK THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD REDISTRIBUTE
test/3uSQlcGCHUU/00014 AND NOTHING HAPPENED AT ALL
test/3uSQlcGCHUU/00015 SO I'M IN THE MEDIA
test/3uSQlcGCHUU/00016 THEY DON'T REPRESENT WHAT OUR VIEWS ARE
test/3uSQlcGCHUU/00017 WE HAD THE BATTLE BETWEEN JEFFERSON AND HAMILTON
test/3vfuCPFb8wk/00001 BUT IT'S MORE COMPLICATED
test/3zqZPujAPuc/00001 SO NO MORE MISSING GUYS

test/5P04stEjJ9E/00004 THEY SIGNED UP BECAUSE THEY WANTED SOME FORM OF REVENGE
test/5P04stEjJ9E/00005 ONE WAS TO BE A SOLDIER
test/5P04stEjJ9E/00006 THE OTHER WAS TO BE A BASEBALL PLAYER

test/c0KYU2j0TM4/00002 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
test/c64M1tZyWPM/00001 SO WHY IS IT
test/c64M1tZyWPM/00002 WHY AREN'T PEOPLE WASHING THEIR HANDS
test/c64M1tZyWPM/00003 DID YOU LEARN TO WASH YOUR HANDS AT HOME
test/c64M1tZyWPM/00004 DID YOU LEARN TO WASH YOUR HANDS IN SCHOOL
test/c9V6OKlY80k/00001 BUT I LOVE IT FOR A TOTALLY DIFFERENT REASON
test/c9V6OKlY80k/00002 THEY MAKE SENSE OF THE PAST
test/cHRZ6OrSvvI/00001 THREE BILLION PEOPLE TODAY WITH CELL PHONES CAN'T ACCESS THE INTERNET
test/cHRZ6OrSvvI/00002 DON'T CREATE SOLUTIONS TO IMPRESS CUSTOMERS
test/cmpu58yv8Sg/00001 WE HARBOR BIAS
test/cmpu58yv8Sg/00002 WE KNOW THAT WE ARE RIGHT AND THEY ARE WRONG
test/cmpu58yv8Sg/00004 WELL THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
test/cmpu58yv8Sg/00005 IF YOU ARE ASKED TO ESTIMATE THE WALKING SPEED OF A MAN IN A VIDEO FOR EXAMPLE YOUR ANSWER
test/cmpu58yv8Sg/00007 HARNESS YOUR INTERNAL STRENGTH
test/d3syTrElgcg/00001 LOOK AT THE END TO SEE THE ANIMAL
test/d6NKdnZvdoo/00002 JUST THINK ABOUT IT
test/d6NKdnZvdoo/00003 BUT IT'S A GLOBAL PHENOMENON
test/dS8n24ZwZcQ/00001 ONE BILLION PEOPLE
test/dS8n24ZwZcQ/00002 BUT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO APPRECIATE
test/dYNc3P4jSt4/00001 SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE OVER
test/dYNc3P4jSt4/00004 SHE NEVER HAD TO DUCK AND COVER UNDER HER DESK AT SCHOOL
test/dYNc3P4jSt4/00006 BUT BEFORE THAT COOPERATION COULD BE REALIZED KENNEDY WAS ASSASSINATED AND THAT PART OF THE
test/dYNc3P4jSt4/00007 BUT IT'S ALSO AN IMPORTANT DATE FOR ANOTHER REASON
test/dYNc3P4jSt4/00008 HAVE INSPIRED A GENERATION OF INNOVATORS
test/ddxHlkIuHqg/00001 I'M A DOCTOR
test/ddxHlkIuHqg/00002 BUT TOO OFTEN MY TREATMENTS MADE THEM FEEL WORSE
test/ddxHlkIuHqg/00004 WE CAN DO THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW
test/eNAHVnkll5M/00001 WHO CLEANS UP AFTER US
test/eNAHVnkll5M/00002 I WANTED TO GET TO KNOW THEM AS INDIVIDUALS
test/eNAHVnkll5M/00003 I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND WHO TAKES THE JOB
test/eNAHVnkll5M/00004 SO I STARTED A RESEARCH PROJECT WITH THEM
test/eNAHVnkll5M/00005 IT WAS A REMARKABLE PRIVILEGE AND AN AMAZING EDUCATION
test/eNAHVnkll5M/00008 THE ECONOMY NEEDS THEM
test/eNAHVnkll5M/00011 TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU
test/eVFYhbHpfqU/00001 PLEASE SIGN HERE RIGHT NOW
test/eVFYhbHpfqU/00002 WHY DOES A JELLYFISH EMIT LIGHT
test/eVFYhbHpfqU/00003 OR A FIREFLY
test/eVFYhbHpfqU/00007 AND THAT'S POWERFUL
test/eVFYhbHpfqU/00008 NO NOT HOW MUCH
test/eVFYhbHpfqU/00009 IT'S MORE ANNOYING
test/eVFYhbHpfqU/00011 IT GOES WRONG
test/eZj5n8ScTkI/00001 I COULDN'T TEAR MYSELF AWAY FROM THE COVERAGE
test/eZj5n8ScTkI/00002 AND OTHERS RESENTED THIS COMPARISON BETWEEN GAY RIGHTS AND CIVIL RIGHTS AND
test/eZj5n8ScTkI/00003 AND THIS WASN'T JUST AN ABSTRACT QUESTION
test/eZj5n8ScTkI/00005 AFRICAN AMERICANS SUPPORTED IT AT A HIGHER LEVEL THAN HAD EVER BEEN RECORDED
test/emW1TQ290ec/00001 CAN WE REALLY SCALE THIS UP
test/eqsXcSaefKI/00001 EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE WEARS OUT
test/eqsXcSaefKI/00002 AND THAT BLEW MY MIND
test/esD6aaIjhek/00001 THEY DON'T HAVE MEANING
test/fC9da6eqaqg/00001 YOU'RE DOING INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WORK
test/fIICVeGW4RY/00001 YOU ARE A HEALER IN A STONE AGE VILLAGE
test/fIICVeGW4RY/00003 BUT EVENTUALLY THEY DID COME AROUND
test/fIICVeGW4RY/00004 AND SO IT'S PERFECT FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
test/fIICVeGW4RY/00006 WE NEED TO SEE BEYOND THE SURFACE
test/fTSXvLzNd0o/00002 THERE WON'T BE A SINGLE MOMENT IN THE SCHEDULE
test/fZ8eyWBQmfU/00001 NOW MY OWN SPECIALITY IS COMBINING DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY AND MAGIC
test/fscaRh2OtXk/00002 I AM SICK TO MY STOMACH
test/fscaRh2OtXk/00003 HOW DO YOU KNOW FOR SURE
test/fscaRh2OtXk/00004 WE CREATED A DIAGNOSTIC TEST
test/fxbCHn6gE3U/00001 I'M THE OPPOSITE
test/fxbCHn6gE3U/00003 THEN SHE GETS THEIR BOSSES TO RATE HOW CREATIVE AND INNOVATIVE THEY ARE
test/fxbCHn6gE3U/00005 SO PEOPLE HEAR ABOUT THIS STUDY AND THEY'RE LIKE GREAT IF I WANT TO GET BETTER AT MY JOB I JUST NEED TO UPGRADE MY BROWSER
test/fxbCHn6gE3U/00007 THEY KNOW YOU CAN FAIL BY STARTING A BUSINESS THAT GOES BANKRUPT OR BY FAILING TO START A BUSINESS AT ALL
test/fxbCHn6gE3U/00008 THEY HAVE BAD IDEAS
test/gSycQufrgK4/00001 THAT'S NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE
test/gSycQufrgK4/00002 SO I WENT IN THAT DIRECTION
test/gVfgkFaswn4/00001 THIS IS A CRISIS THAT'S GETTING WORSE DAY BY DAY
test/gVfgkFaswn4/00002 SO THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND QUESTION CAN WE CHANGE
test/gVfgkFaswn4/00003 WE NOW HAVE A MORAL CHALLENGE THAT IS IN THE TRADITION OF OTHERS THAT WE HAVE
test/gVfgkFaswn4/00006 BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE LEARNED IS THAT APPARENTLY IT MATTERS IF A NEW PRODUCT OR SERVICE IS
test/gtpTd3ywwiE/00001 BUT THAT'S KIND OF A BIG PROBLEM
test/hQigUH0vZSE/00001 AND ALL OF THAT SOUNDS GREAT UNTIL YOU FIGURE OUT WHERE IT'S REALLY GOING
test/hiIcwt88o94/00001 I JUST DISAGREE WITH THIS
test/hiIcwt88o94/00002 LIKE WE EVOLVED ON THIS PLANET IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL THE OTHER ANIMALS WITH WHICH WE SHARE
test/hiIcwt88o94/00003 AND SO I THINK THAT NATURE IS NOT THAT WHICH IS UNTOUCHED BY HUMANITY MAN OR WOMAN
test/hiIcwt88o94/00005 I WANT TO GO
test/hiIcwt88o94/00006 AND I WAS LIKE OH THE AMAZON
test/hiIcwt88o94/00008 THEY GROW CROPS
test/hiIcwt88o94/00010 THERE'S PEOPLE EVERYWHERE
test/hiIcwt88o94/00017 AND THIS IS CRAZY
test/hiIcwt88o94/00018 AND I'M SURE THE FIGURES ARE SIMILAR IN OTHER COUNTRIES
test/hiIcwt88o94/00019 EVERY KID LIVES NEAR NATURE
test/hiIcwt88o94/00020 WE'VE JUST SOMEHOW FORGOTTEN HOW TO SEE IT
test/hiIcwt88o94/00023 THERE'S POLLINATION GOING ON
test/hxsnKwmW0dk/00002 WE ARE NOW VERY COMFORTABLE IMAGINING UNIMAGINABLE TECHNOLOGICAL ACHIEVEMENT
test/hxsnKwmW0dk/00003 I HAVE AN IDEA FOR SAVING THE WORLD
test/iPE2SiCCo0w/00001 MOST OF MY FRIENDS WERE TAKING JAPANESE
test/iPE2SiCCo0w/00002 SO I THOUGHT WHY NOT PUNISH MYSELF
test/iPE2SiCCo0w/00004 I WAS ALWAYS VERY SMALL
test/iPE2SiCCo0w/00007 SO WATER WAS SOMETHING THAT SCARED ME TO BEGIN WITH
test/iPE2SiCCo0w/00008 BUT I WOULD GO IN ON OCCASION
test/iPE2SiCCo0w/00009 AND I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE GREAT FUN
test/iPE2SiCCo0w/00013 AND THIS ROUTINE WENT ON FOR SOME TIME
test/iPE2SiCCo0w/00015 I TRIED EVERYTHING
test/iPE2SiCCo0w/00018 AND THIS BECAME MY HOLY GRAIL MY ROSETTA STONE
test/iPE2SiCCo0w/00021 AND NOW I LOVE LANGUAGES
test/iPE2SiCCo0w/00023 I KNOW NOTHING
test/iqEHuBST2qQ/00001 AND THEN I THOUGHT THERE'S GOT TO BE A BETTER WAY
test/j7fRIGphgtk/00001 WELL I DIDN'T HAVE ANY IDEA
test/j7fRIGphgtk/00002 OUR CITY COULDN'T POSSIBLY HANDLE ANY MORE CARS
test/j7fRIGphgtk/00004 I HAD TO HAVE FAITH
test/j7fRIGphgtk/00005 IT WOULD BE A MALL AND NOT A PARK
test/jPf0LjZAS14/00001 IS IT ABOUT EARNING AS MUCH AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN
test/jPf0LjZAS14/00003 HOW SHOULD WE WORK
test/jPf0LjZAS14/00004 HOW SHOULD WE LIVE
test/jPf0LjZAS14/00008 WE NEED PORTABLE HEALTH BENEFITS
test/jPf0LjZAS14/00009 I WOULD NEVER WANT TO DO THAT
test/jPf0LjZAS14/00010 WE NEED TO REINVENT LABOR ORGANIZING
test/jbHpF7EySck/00001 THEY WANT TO BE PART OF IT
test/jbHpF7EySck/00002 AND THEY SAY I WANT TO WORK IN GLOBAL POVERTY BUT WHAT WILL IT MEAN ABOUT MY CAREER
test/jcSSY9rDN2g/00001 THERE'S A FLIP SIDE AS WELL
test/jcSSY9rDN2g/00002 IT'S SHOCKING TO REALIZE THAT ONLY 28 PERCENT OF AMERICAN
test/jcp5vvxtEaU/00001 HOW DO YOU GET INFORMED
test/jcp5vvxtEaU/00002 WE PAID TWO TO THREE TIMES MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE
test/jcp5vvxtEaU/00004 THERE'S NO MORE OF IT
test/jcp5vvxtEaU/00006 LET'S GO BACK AND VISIT OUR EQUATION
test/jcp5vvxtEaU/00008 WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT
test/jcp5vvxtEaU/00009 EVEN IF WE GET EVERYBODY WORKING ON IT WE'VE GOT TO BE STRATEGIC
test/jcp5vvxtEaU/00010 SO WE DID THE ANALYSIS AGAIN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY
test/jcp5vvxtEaU/00011 SO IT'S THE DEMAND THAT BRINGS THEM TO THE TABLE
test/jcp5vvxtEaU/00012 SUSTAINABILITY HAS GOT TO BE A PRE COMPETITIVE ISSUE
test/jggHw5PdQV0/00001 AND MY WHOLE WORLD DID OPEN UP
test/jggHw5PdQV0/00002 AND WHO DOES THAT BENEFIT
test/jggHw5PdQV0/00003 WE NOW HAVE A PLATFORM
test/jiUKpX09zo4/00001 IT REALLY IS QUITE PHENOMENAL
test/jtVIDBs60S8/00001 THAT WAS POWERFUL
test/jtVIDBs60S8/00004 IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT HARD
test/jtVIDBs60S8/00005 RAISE YOUR HANDS
test/k2hQL9Zrokk/00001 TAKE MY CHILD
test/k2hQL9Zrokk/00002 I BELIEVE A STORY THERE HAS TO BE TOLD
test/k2hQL9Zrokk/00003 THEY DON'T GET THEIR MONEY OUT
test/k2hQL9Zrokk/00005 SHE WORKED IN A BANK
test/k2hQL9Zrokk/00006 I HAVE TO REPORT IT
test/k2hQL9Zrokk/00008 WHO CARES ABOUT BOSNIA
test/kEKzl6fub2w/00001 WHICH INCIDENTALLY IS ONLY A THIRD CORRECT
test/kEKzl6fub2w/00002 I DON'T MEAN GIVING UP THE INTERNET
test/kEKzl6fub2w/00003 THIS IS YOUR CHANCE
test/ka8L1YMR88U/00001 THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN TO ME
test/ka8L1YMR88U/00004 MAKE IT GO AWAY
test/ka8L1YMR88U/00005 MAKE IT GO AWAY
test/ka8L1YMR88U/00006 MAKE IT GO AWAY
test/ka8L1YMR88U/00008 WE CAN'T IDENTIFY WITH THAT PART
test/kcEIsbO0ivA/00001 YOU MIGHT GET IMPEACHED FOR THAT
test/kwYxHPXIaao/00001 WELL NOT YET
test/l5vZHuAtDZA/00001 WELL THAT'S GOING TO BE A BREEDING GROUND FOR COMPASSION
test/l5vZHuAtDZA/00003 SO WAS MOTHER TERESA
test/lmyZMtPVodo/00001 THAT IS SOME DEEP DEEP EMOTION WHEN YOU WOULD WANT TO DO THAT
test/lmyZMtPVodo/00002 WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THESE FORCES
test/lrSmXnUoUXM/00002 WELL GUESS WHAT
test/lrSmXnUoUXM/00003 NOW I KNOW WHY I'M HERE
test/m6X1i8khmt8/00001 AND I WAS REALLY SCARED

test/mSHBma0Ithk/00001 THEY WANT TO GET OUT
test/mSHBma0Ithk/00002 ALLOW MANY PEOPLE TO COME IN
test/mSHBma0Ithk/00003 LET US HAVE A HONG KONG NEARBY
test/mSHBma0Ithk/00006 WHEN WE SHARE IDEAS WE ALL GET MORE
test/mc0vhSseGk4/00001 SO IT'S MORE ABOUT CAPTURING AN IDEA THAN ABOUT CAPTURING A MOMENT REALLY
test/mgcjr1yz7ow/00002 IS IT ABOUT SYSTEMS
test/mgcjr1yz7ow/00003 IS IT ABOUT EQUALITY
test/mgcjr1yz7ow/00005 I STARTED LOOKING AT THEM REALLY CAREFULLY
test/mgcjr1yz7ow/00006 I LOOKED AT MY FRIEND WHO DRILLED SEVEN DRY WELLS WRITING OFF MORE THAN A BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE
test/mgcjr1yz7ow/00008 THESE GUYS COULD BE TRUE TO THEIR PURPOSE WHICH WAS FINDING OIL AND GAS
test/mgcjr1yz7ow/00009 AND THEY WERE BASICALLY HAVING FUN
test/mgcjr1yz7ow/00013 WE NEED TO BE PART OF A COMMUNITY TO SURVIVE
test/mgcjr1yz7ow/00015 IT'S VERY HARD TO MAKE THEM PART OF OUR RATIONAL DECISION
test/mgcjr1yz7ow/00016 WE ALL KNOW DEEP INSIDE WHAT THE ANSWER IS
test/mgcjr1yz7ow/00017 WE'VE KNOWN SINCE WE WERE BABIES
test/mjDjbJJlqZ0/00001 WE GO OUT THERE AND WE HOP IN OUR CARS AND WE DRIVE FROM PLACE TO PLACE
test/mxNpNuogqsY/00003 WHAT ARE THE RESEARCHERS LEARNING
test/mxNpNuogqsY/00004 SO I WAS JEALOUS
test/mxNpNuogqsY/00005 I KNOW I DIDN'T
test/mxNpNuogqsY/00006 I THINK I'M A NORMAL PERSON
test/n3kNlFMXslo/00002 THAT'S LIKE FINDING AN EXTRA HOUR IN THE DAY
test/n3kNlFMXslo/00003 YET WHEN SHE HAD TO FIND SEVEN HOURS BECAUSE THERE IS WATER ALL OVER HER BASEMENT SHE FOUND
test/n3kNlFMXslo/00005 SO HOW DO WE DO THAT
test/n3kNlFMXslo/00006 BUT YOU CAN WRITE IT
test/n3kNlFMXslo/00010 YOU SAY YOU'RE WORKING MORE THAN 60 HOURS
test/n3kNlFMXslo/00011 WELL ARE YOU SURE
test/n3kNlFMXslo/00012 AND THAT'S EVEN IF YOU'RE WORKING WAY MORE THAN FULL TIME HOURS
test/n3kNlFMXslo/00013 WE DON'T EVEN NEED THAT MUCH TIME TO DO AMAZING THINGS
test/nASJ0510Pxs/00002 SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO RELY ON PEOPLE THAT ARE GETTING SCARCER TO HELP THEM
test/nASJ0510Pxs/00003 THANKS VERY MUCH

test/ni4FV5zL6lM/00001 GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE EXTREMELY MAD
test/ni4FV5zL6lM/00003 BUT THOSE SURVEILLANCE FEATURES COME AT A COST
test/npNYP2vzaPo/00001 HOW CAN WE GET SO MUCH INFORMATION OUT OF SO LITTLE MOTION
test/npNYP2vzaPo/00002 WE WOULD JUST GET NOISE BACK
test/npNYP2vzaPo/00004 WE PUSH AND PULL AND POKE AND PROD THINGS
test/o1Z4F4e2Bw4/00001 HOW DO YOU FIND A DINOSAUR
test/o1Z4F4e2Bw4/00002 THAT'S THE MAGIC OF THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD
test/o1Z4F4e2Bw4/00003 BUT WE ONLY GET ONE HISTORY AND IT'S THE ONE THAT WE HAVE
test/o1Z4F4e2Bw4/00004 BUT THIS PARTICULAR REALITY WAS NOT INEVITABLE

test/psN1DORYYV0/00004 SHE SAID YEAH
test/psN1DORYYV0/00005 WHY DID YOU BRING THIS UP
test/psN1DORYYV0/00006 HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND
test/psN1DORYYV0/00008 I'M A FIFTH GENERATION TEXAN

test/q2gO4DKVpa8/00001 I AM CERTAINLY NOT THE HARDEST WORKING
test/q2gO4DKVpa8/00002 I WAS A MEDIOCRE STUDENT
test/q2gO4DKVpa8/00004 IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED
test/q2gO4DKVpa8/00005 I WAS THE FIRST NON FAMILY INVESTOR IN AMAZON
test/q2gO4DKVpa8/00006 THIS IS NONSENSE
test/qWNae7vYK6s/00001 THOUSANDS OF WOMEN STARTED REACHING OUT TO ME TO SHARE THEIR OWN STORIES OF PAIN AND AGONY AND SHAME
test/qWNae7vYK6s/00002 AND WHEN SHE WENT TO COMPLAIN TO A MAJOR HE SAID WHAT
test/qWNae7vYK6s/00003 AGAIN IN A CAR
test/qWNae7vYK6s/00004 I WAS PETRIFIED
test/qWNae7vYK6s/00006 SEXUAL HARASSMENT DOESN'T DISCRIMINATE
test/qWNae7vYK6s/00007 NOT A LOT OF HANDS
test/qWNae7vYK6s/00008 YOU DON'T GET THE SAME WITNESSES OR DEPOSITIONS
test/qWNae7vYK6s/00009 THEY JUST DO IT
test/qYUmI5kGsYk/00001 SO WE NEED THE SOLUTIONS AND THESE PEOPLE PLAYING THE GAME THEY ARE TRYING OUT
test/qafSjNLjedo/00001 AND WE'VE ALL HEARD THAT KIND OF STORY BEFORE RIGHT
test/qlty0OPcU6k/00001 NOW DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT
test/qlty0OPcU6k/00002 THAT WOULD NOT WORK
test/qsJYrwzfd6w/00004 AND AFTER THAT INITIAL PROTOTYPE WE SET OUT TO MAKE FREE AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE SO THAT OTHERS DO NOT HAVE
test/qsJYrwzfd6w/00005 AND THEN GUESS WHAT
test/qsJYrwzfd6w/00006 COULD WE LEVERAGE THE CLOUD
test/qsJYrwzfd6w/00007 SO WHY DON'T WE LEVERAGE THAT
test/rBKV4rOgSJU/00008 AND I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT BECAUSE I EXPECTED ONE OF THESE
test/rFpDK2KhAgw/00001 THEY HAVE SOCIAL MEANING
test/rFpDK2KhAgw/00002 THEY WERE UNEXPECTED PLEASURES
test/rFpDK2KhAgw/00003 SOMETIMES IT GOES FURTHER
test/rFpDK2KhAgw/00006 OR WHERE DOES HE LIVE
test/rFpDK2KhAgw/00007 STRANGERS MIGHT ASK EACH OTHER FOR A SIP OF WATER
test/rGfhahVBIQw/00001 AND THIS LEADS TO ODDITIES
test/rGfhahVBIQw/00002 BUT THIS IS THE SOURCE OF INNOVATION
test/rP7nmdDA1Fg/00001 WELL WHY IS THAT
test/rP7nmdDA1Fg/00002 NOW I WILL MAINTAIN
test/rP7nmdDA1Fg/00005 WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE IF THEY TALK LIKE JERRY SEINFELD
test/rP7nmdDA1Fg/00006 I THINK WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT PEOPLE JUST COULDN'T SEE WHAT WAS IN FRONT OF THEM
test/rP7nmdDA1Fg/00007 WELL WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES THIS MAKE
test/rSSanSYZDT4/00001 AND SO WE NEED TO DO BETTER AT COPYING THEIR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT TO GET THEM TO THRIVE

test/s0YjL9rZyR0/00004 IT IS WRONG
test/s0YjL9rZyR0/00005 IT IS IRRESPONSIBLE
test/s0YjL9rZyR0/00007 ARE WE BRAVE ENOUGH TO WELCOME IT
test/s0YjL9rZyR0/00008 BUT IT'S DIFFERENT
test/s4smjT1qwZU/00002 THERE'S NO STRUCTURE
test/sVtIuDKFO1c/00001 GETTING A COLLEGE EDUCATION IS A 20 YEAR INVESTMENT
test/sVtIuDKFO1c/00003 WHEN YOU GROW UP POOR YOU WANT TO BE RICH
test/shG0ezBeeJc/00001 HOW COULD I LET THEM DOWN
test/shG0ezBeeJc/00002 SOMETIMES IT'S MESSY AND IT'S ALWAYS UNPREDICTABLE

test/sxnlvwprfSc/00007 THIS IS WHEN I WAS IN TEXAS
test/sxnlvwprfSc/00008 THEY HAD HER SCANNED INSIDE OUT
test/sxnlvwprfSc/00011 I WOULD LISTEN TO THE HEART
test/t2gbcVaZ448/00002 AFTER ALL I WAS A BIT UNCONVENTIONAL
test/t2gbcVaZ448/00003 I'VE STRUGGLED TO SAY THOSE WORDS BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE DEFINED BY THEM
test/t2gbcVaZ448/00004 WHAT IF I HAD TOLD HER MY STORY YEARS AGO
test/t7Xr3AsBEK4/00001 SO YOU WANT TO GO TO THAT BOARD MEETING BUT YOU ONLY WANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE BITS THAT INTEREST
test/t7Xr3AsBEK4/00002 THAT ROBOT PUT ON A GREAT SHOW
test/t7Xr3AsBEK4/00004 WE ALMOST DON'T FEEL OURSELVES
test/t7Xr3AsBEK4/00005 SO WHAT DO WE DO
test/t7Xr3AsBEK4/00006 WE CONNECT MORE AND MORE
test/t7Xr3AsBEK4/00007 WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE'RE NOT ABLE TO APPRECIATE WHO THEY ARE
test/t7Xr3AsBEK4/00008 AND THAT'S WHAT I'M CALLING FOR HERE NOW
test/t7Xr3AsBEK4/00009 DO THE SAME THING AT WORK
test/ta2Wvy9FSgA/00001 THAT'S PRETTY COOL
test/ta2Wvy9FSgA/00002 WE HAVE THE PLAN
test/ta2Wvy9FSgA/00003 BUT IF THEY DON'T STAY IN PARIS THE INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE WILL BE OVERWHELMING
test/tbSWdVA4Sbo/00001 WE MIGHT SAY THEN WELL LET'S NOT WORRY ABOUT THIS

test/tiSiSM3pk5M/00009 YOU'VE BROKEN YOUR BACK
test/tiSiSM3pk5M/00010 YOU'LL NEVER WALK AGAIN
